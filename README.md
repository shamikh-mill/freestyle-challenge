README.md

For clean formatting and parsing, in my test cases I am assuming that the comma-delimited text files are specically only comma-related, i.e they say 'pizza,pasta' instead of 'pizza, pasta',
like a csv file would. Spaces can still exist inside names of foods and drinks. 
I'm assuming the text files don't have newline or space characters at the end of the files in my test cases.
